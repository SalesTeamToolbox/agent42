# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** Agent42 must provide a rich, VS Code-quality Claude Code chat experience in its web IDE
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Core Chat UI

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Frontend Chat UI — in progress)
Plan: 3 of 5 in Phase 2 complete
Status: Phase 2 in progress — Plans 02-01, 02-02, 02-03 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-18 — Plan 02-03 complete (CDN deps in index.html + .cc-chat-* CSS in style.css)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 6.2 min
- Total execution time: 37 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase                | Plans    | Total  | Avg/Plan |
|----------------------|----------|--------|----------|
| 01-backend-ws-bridge | 3/3 DONE | 29 min | 9.7 min  |
| 02-core-chat-ui      | 3/5      | 8 min  | 2.7 min  |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Phase 1 must ship before any frontend work — `cc_chat_ws` endpoint is strict prerequisite
- DOMPurify sanitization is non-negotiable in Phase 2; cannot be retrofitted
- Append-only DOM and scroll-pin must be Phase 2 initial implementation, not added later
- StrongWall.ai deprecated (causes CC disconnects); smart hybrid: CC subscription for interactive
- Session persistence (sessionStorage + --resume) belongs in Phase 3, not deferred to v2
- LAYOUT-04 (Monaco diff editor) grouped with layout modes in Phase 4 — all UI arrangement work
- xfail(raises=ImportError, strict=False) pattern for tests importing symbols not yet implemented
- Wave 0 source inspection tests left as RED AssertionError — correct TDD state; Plan 02 GREEN flips them
- _parse_cc_event, _save_session, _load_session are closure-scoped inside create_app() — not importable as module attributes; xfail tests for direct import remain xfail by design
- claude auth status result cached 60s to avoid Node.js cold-start latency per connection
- subprocess args always a Python list; user_message passed as positional arg (no shell=True)
- Auth status check uses exit code only (not JSON parsing) — insulated from claude CLI schema changes
- Session listing uses per-file try/except — corrupt files do not break GET /api/cc/sessions
- Wave 0 scaffold uses source-text inspection (Path.read_text) — identical to test_ide_html.py; 20 tests across 5 classes; TestCCChatStop uses inspect.getsource(dashboard.server) for backend pattern checks
- Use highlight.min.js (full bundle) not core.min.js — core has zero language definitions built in
- hljs CSS scoped to .cc-chat-messages to prevent conflicts with existing .md-code-block styles
- CDN load order: marked -> marked-highlight -> hljs -> DOMPurify -> app.js (UMD globals must exist when app.js runs)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 research flag: verify CC PermissionRequest event payload structure against current CC version before implementing permission UI
- Open: tool_complete.output field path with --verbose not verified from live session; current implementation emits empty string (safe for Phase 2, may need update in Phase 3)
- Pre-existing test_auth_flow.py failure: test_protected_endpoint_requires_auth checks /api/tasks returns 401 but gets 404 — unrelated to CC bridge, deferred

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-18
Stopped at: Plan 02-03 complete — CDN deps + CSS done. index.html has 4 CDN libs, style.css has all .cc-chat-* classes. Ready for Plan 02-04 (JS rendering engine).
Resume file: None
