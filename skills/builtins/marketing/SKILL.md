# Marketing Skill

Write persuasive marketing copy that connects with the target audience and drives action.

## Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action
Use for landing pages, sales emails, and long-form content.
1. **Attention:** Hook with a bold claim, surprising statistic, or question.
2. **Interest:** Describe the problem or opportunity the reader cares about.
3. **Desire:** Show how the product solves it — benefits, social proof, specifics.
4. **Action:** Close with a clear, single call-to-action (CTA).

### PAS — Problem, Agitate, Solution
Use for ads, email subject lines, and short-form copy.
1. **Problem:** Name the specific pain point.
2. **Agitate:** Amplify it — what happens if they do nothing?
3. **Solution:** Present your product as the resolution. Transition into the CTA.

### BAB — Before, After, Bridge
Use for case studies, testimonials, and transformation stories.
1. **Before:** The audience's current painful situation.
2. **After:** Life after the problem is solved.
3. **Bridge:** How your product gets them from Before to After.

## Tone and Voice

- **Know the brand voice.** Identify the tone before writing (professional, playful, bold, minimal).
- **Write for one person.** Address the reader as "you."
- **Be specific.** Replace "best-in-class" with "reduces build time by 40%."
- **Use active voice.** "Ship faster" beats "Faster shipping is enabled."
- **Match the channel.** LinkedIn, Twitter, and landing pages each read differently.

## Content Types

- **Landing Page:** One clear headline, 3-5 benefit sections, social proof, single CTA repeated top and bottom, FAQ for objections.
- **Email Campaign:** Subject under 50 chars, one idea per email, short paragraphs, one CTA, P.S. line for urgency.
- **Social Media:** Hook in first line, scannable format, end with CTA or question, tailor to platform norms.
- **Product Description:** Lead with benefit not feature, use specific language ("weighs 340g" not "lightweight"), address key objection.

## A/B Testing Principles

- **Test one variable at a time:** headline, CTA, image, or layout — not all at once.
- **Define the metric before testing:** CTR, conversion rate, time on page.
- **Run to statistical significance.** Do not declare a winner after 50 impressions.
- **Document results.** Build a knowledge base of what works.
- **Test high-impact elements first:** headlines, CTAs, hero images.

## Guidelines

- Start by clarifying: Who is the audience? What action should they take? What is the key message?
- Benefits over features. Translate every feature into what it means for the reader.
- Remove jargon unless the audience expects it.
- Every sentence should build desire or remove an objection. Cut everything else.
- Read copy aloud. If it sounds unnatural, rewrite it.
