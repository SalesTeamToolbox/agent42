# Presentation Skill

Create compelling presentations that inform, persuade, and drive action.

## Slide Structure Principles

### The Pyramid Principle
- **Start with the answer.** Don't build up to the conclusion — lead with it.
- **Support with 3 key points.** Each point gets its own section.
- **Back each point with evidence.** Data, examples, or logic.

### Slide Rules
- **One idea per slide.** If you need two minutes to explain a slide, split it.
- **6 words per bullet, 6 bullets max.** Slides are prompts, not documents.
- **Title = Takeaway.** "Revenue grew 34% in Q3" not "Q3 Revenue Results."
- **Visual > Text.** A chart is better than a table. A table is better than paragraphs.

## Presentation Archetypes

### The Status Update
1. Agenda (30 seconds)
2. Key metrics / scorecard
3. Wins & progress
4. Challenges & blockers
5. Decisions needed
6. Next steps

### The Pitch
1. Problem (pain point)
2. Solution (your approach)
3. Why now (urgency)
4. How it works (demo / walkthrough)
5. Traction / proof (data, testimonials)
6. Ask (what you need)

### The Strategy Deck
1. Situation (where we are)
2. Challenge (what's in the way)
3. Options (2-3 paths with tradeoffs)
4. Recommendation (your pick + rationale)
5. Implementation plan
6. Expected outcomes

### The Retrospective
1. What we set out to do
2. What happened (results + data)
3. What went well
4. What didn't
5. Lessons learned
6. Changes for next time

## Data Presentation

- **Label axes and units.** Never assume context is obvious.
- **Highlight the insight.** Use color, arrows, or annotations.
- **Compare to a baseline.** "15% better than industry average."
- **Simplify.** If a chart needs more than 10 seconds to understand, simplify it.
- **Round numbers.** "$4.2M" not "$4,187,493.21."

## Storytelling

- **Situation-Complication-Resolution.** Set the scene, introduce tension, deliver the answer.
- **Concrete examples.** "Customer X reduced churn by 30%" beats abstract claims.
- **Emotion + Logic.** Lead with why it matters (emotion), support with how it works (logic).
- **Memorable close.** End with one sentence the audience will remember.

## Deliverable Format

When creating presentation content:
- Use the outline tool to structure the deck.
- Write speaker notes for each slide (what to say, not what's on screen).
- Include transition lines between sections.
- Specify where data visualizations are needed.
