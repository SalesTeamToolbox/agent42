# Strategy Analysis Skill

Conduct rigorous strategic analysis using established business frameworks.

## Frameworks

### SWOT Analysis
Evaluate an organization or initiative across four dimensions:
- **Strengths:** Internal advantages — what do we do well?
- **Weaknesses:** Internal limitations — where are we vulnerable?
- **Opportunities:** External factors we can leverage — market trends, gaps.
- **Threats:** External risks — competitors, regulation, market shifts.

**Best practice:** Be specific. "Strong brand" is weak. "Brand recognition at 82% in target demo" is strong.

### Porter's Five Forces
Assess industry attractiveness and competitive dynamics:
1. **Competitive Rivalry:** How intense is competition? Many players? Price wars?
2. **Supplier Power:** Can suppliers raise prices? Are they concentrated?
3. **Buyer Power:** Can customers negotiate? Are switching costs low?
4. **Threat of Substitutes:** What alternatives exist? How easy to switch?
5. **Threat of New Entrants:** How hard is it to enter the market? Capital needs? Regulation?

### Competitive Analysis
For each competitor, evaluate:
- **Positioning:** How do they describe themselves? Target audience?
- **Product:** Features, pricing, packaging, differentiation.
- **GTM:** Channels, partnerships, marketing strategy.
- **Strengths/Weaknesses:** Where they win/lose vs. us.
- **Trajectory:** Growing? Pivoting? Declining?

### Go-To-Market Planning
Structure a GTM strategy:
1. **Target market:** Segment, persona, pain point.
2. **Value proposition:** Why us? What's different?
3. **Pricing:** Model, tiers, competitive position.
4. **Channels:** How do we reach customers?
5. **Launch plan:** Phases, milestones, success criteria.
6. **Metrics:** KPIs for each phase (awareness, activation, revenue).

## Analysis Quality Standards

- **Data-driven:** Support claims with numbers, not opinions.
- **Balanced:** Present both bullish and bearish perspectives.
- **Actionable:** End every analysis with "so what?" — clear next steps.
- **Time-bounded:** Specify the planning horizon (90 days, 1 year, 3 years).
- **Assumption-explicit:** State assumptions clearly so they can be challenged.

## Deliverable Format

Structure strategy deliverables as:
1. **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
2. **Situation Analysis** (current state with data)
3. **Framework Application** (SWOT, Porter's, competitive matrix)
4. **Options** (2-3 strategic alternatives with pros/cons)
5. **Recommendation** (chosen path with rationale)
6. **Implementation Roadmap** (phases, owners, timelines)
7. **Risks & Mitigations** (what could go wrong, contingencies)
