|---------|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Pricing | | | | |
| Key Feature 1 | | | | |
| Key Feature 2 | | | | |
| Target Market | | | | |
| Strengths | | | | |
| Weaknesses | | | | |

### 3. Pricing Analysis
- List all pricing tiers for each competitor
- Note free tiers, trials, and enterprise pricing

For each competitor, analyze:
- **Strengths**: What they do better
- **Weaknesses**: Where they fall short
- **Opportunities**: Gaps you can exploit
