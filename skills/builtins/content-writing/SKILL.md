# Content Writing Skill

Write high-quality content that engages readers, delivers value, and achieves its purpose.

## Content Types

### Blog Posts
- **Hook:** Start with a question, surprising fact, or bold claim in the first 2 sentences.
- **Structure:** Use H2/H3 headings every 200-300 words for scannability.
- **Length:** 800-2000 words for most topics. Longer for in-depth guides.
- **Voice:** Write conversationally. Use "you" to address the reader directly.
- **Closing:** End with a clear takeaway and call-to-action.

### Long-Form Articles
- **Research first.** Include data, examples, and expert perspectives.
- **Outline before writing.** Use the outline tool to structure the piece.
- **Thesis statement:** State your main argument in the introduction.
- **Supporting evidence:** Each section should build on the thesis with facts.
- **Transitions:** Connect sections with logical bridges, not abrupt jumps.

### SEO Content
- **Primary keyword:** Use naturally in title, H1, first paragraph, and 2-3 H2s.
- **Secondary keywords:** Sprinkle related terms throughout (don't stuff).
- **Meta description:** Write a 150-160 character summary with keyword.
- **Internal links:** Reference 2-3 related pieces where relevant.
- **Image alt text:** Describe images using natural keyword variations.

## Writing Process

1. **Clarify the brief:** Audience, purpose, key message, word count, tone.
2. **Research:** Gather facts, data, and examples before writing.
3. **Outline:** Structure the piece with headings and key points.
4. **Draft:** Write the first version without self-editing.
5. **Revise:** Tighten prose, check flow, eliminate redundancy.
6. **Polish:** Grammar, formatting, links, metadata.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Does the opening hook the reader in the first 2 sentences?
- [ ] Is there one clear main idea?
- [ ] Does every paragraph support or advance the main idea?
- [ ] Is the language specific (not vague or buzzwordy)?
- [ ] Are sentences under 25 words on average?
- [ ] Is the CTA clear and actionable?
- [ ] Has the content been checked with the content_analyzer tool?

## Content Calendar Planning

When asked to create a content calendar:
- Define themes per week/month aligned with business goals.
- Mix content types: how-to, thought leadership, case study, listicle.
- Assign target keywords to each piece.
- Include publish dates, channels, and promotion plans.
