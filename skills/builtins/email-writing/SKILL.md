# Email Writing Skill

Draft emails that are clear, purposeful, and get the response you need.

## Email Types

- **Outreach:** Personalize the opening, state your purpose in two sentences, keep under 150 words, end with a low-friction ask.
- **Follow-Up:** Reference prior interaction by date, add new value (not just "checking in"), restate your ask. Space 3-5 business days apart.
- **Announcement:** Lead with what changed and why it matters, bullet points for details, state required actions and deadlines.
- **Support:** Acknowledge the problem first, provide numbered resolution steps, set expectations for timing.

## Email Structure

| Component | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Specific, benefit-oriented, under 50 characters. No clickbait. |
| **Opening** | Reference shared context. Avoid "I hope this finds you well" in outreach. |
| **Body** | One topic per email. Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences). |
| **Call to action** | One specific request. Make it a question when possible. |
| **Closing** | Match formality to the relationship. |

## Tone Matching

- **Formal:** No contractions, measured language. "Best regards," or "Sincerely,"
- **Professional friendly:** Contractions fine, conversational. "Best," or "Thanks,"
- **Casual:** Direct, brief, personality welcome. "Cheers," or just your name.
- **Urgent:** Lead with deadline. Bold key dates. Keep it short.

## Templates

### Cold Outreach
```
Subject: [Specific benefit] for [their company]

Hi [Name],
[One sentence referencing their work.] I'm [name] at [company] — we help
[their type of company] [achieve outcome]. [One proof sentence.]
Would you be open to a brief call [next Tue or Wed]?
[Sign-off]
```

### Follow-Up
```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],
I reached out on [date] about [topic]. [One new piece of value.]
Is this worth exploring, or should I close the loop?
[Sign-off]
```

### Announcement
```
Subject: [What changed] — action needed by [date]

Team,
Starting [date], [one-sentence change description].

What's changing:
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

What you need to do:
- [Action] by [deadline]

Questions? Reach out to [contact].
[Sign-off]
```

## Guidelines

- **One email, one purpose.** Two unrelated topics means two emails.
- **Front-load the key message.** Most readers scan the first two lines only.
- **Proofread the recipient's name.** Getting it wrong undermines the message.
- **Think mobile.** Short paragraphs and clear structure matter on small screens.
- **Reply promptly.** If you cannot fully respond, acknowledge receipt and set a timeline.
