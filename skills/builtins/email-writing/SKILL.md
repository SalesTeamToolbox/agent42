# Email Writing Skill

Draft emails that are clear, purposeful, and get the response you need.

## Email Types

### Outreach

- **Goal:** Start a relationship or conversation with someone who does not know you.
- Open with a specific, personalized reference to their work — show you did your homework.
- State your purpose within the first two sentences.
- Keep it under 150 words. Respect their time.
- End with a low-friction ask: "Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week?"

### Follow-Up

- **Goal:** Re-engage after no response or continue a prior conversation.
- Reference the previous interaction with a specific date or topic.
- Add new value — a relevant article, update, or insight — rather than just "checking in."
- Be direct: restate what you are asking for.
- Space follow-ups appropriately: 3-5 business days for the first, 7-10 for subsequent.

### Announcement

- **Goal:** Inform a group about something new, changed, or important.
- Lead with what changed and why it matters to the reader.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple changes.
- Clearly state any action required and the deadline.
- Provide a link or contact for questions.

### Support / Response

- **Goal:** Resolve an issue or answer a question helpfully.
- Acknowledge the problem first. Show you understand before jumping to solutions.
- Provide clear, numbered steps if the resolution requires action from the recipient.
- Set expectations: what happens next and when.
- Close with an invitation to follow up if the issue persists.

## Email Structure

Every email should have these components:

| Component | Purpose | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| **Subject line** | Get the email opened | Be specific and benefit-oriented. Under 50 characters. Avoid clickbait. |
| **Opening line** | Establish context | Reference a shared connection, prior conversation, or the reader's situation. Never open with "I hope this finds you well" in outreach. |
| **Body** | Deliver the message | One topic per email. Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences). Use formatting for clarity. |
| **Call to action** | Drive the next step | One specific, easy-to-act-on request. Make it a question when possible. |
| **Closing** | End professionally | Match the formality of the relationship. Include signature with relevant contact info. |

## Tone Matching

Adapt your tone to the context:

- **Formal:** Board communications, legal, executive outreach. Full sentences, no contractions, measured language. Sign off: "Best regards," or "Sincerely,".
- **Professional friendly:** Most business emails. Contractions are fine, conversational but purposeful. Sign off: "Best," or "Thanks,".
- **Casual:** Internal team, close colleagues. Direct and brief. Personality is welcome. Sign off: "Cheers," or just your name.
- **Urgent:** Incident response, time-sensitive requests. Lead with the urgency and deadline. Bold key dates or actions. Keep it short. Sign off: "Thanks — need this by [time]."

## Templates

### Cold Outreach

```
Subject: [Specific benefit or reference] for [their company]

Hi [Name],

[One sentence referencing their specific work, achievement, or content.]

I'm [your name] at [company]. We help [their type of company] [achieve specific outcome]. [One sentence of proof: metric, client name, or result.]

Would you be open to a brief call [next Tuesday or Wednesday] to see if this could help [their company]?

[Sign-off]
```

### Follow-Up After No Response

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

I reached out on [date] about [topic]. I know things get busy, so I wanted to resurface this.

[One new piece of value — a relevant insight, resource, or update.]

Is this something worth exploring, or should I close the loop?

[Sign-off]
```

### Internal Announcement

```
Subject: [What changed] — action needed by [date]

Team,

Starting [date], [describe the change in one sentence].

**What's changing:**
- [Change 1]
- [Change 2]

**What you need to do:**
- [Action 1] by [deadline]
- [Action 2] by [deadline]

[Link to documentation or detailed info]

Questions? Reply here or reach out to [contact].

## Guidelines

- **One email, one purpose.** If you have two unrelated topics, send two emails.
- **Front-load the key message.** Many readers only scan the first two lines and the CTA.
- **Proofread the recipient's name.** Getting a name wrong undermines the entire message.
- **Use formatting sparingly.** Bold for emphasis on one or two key items. Avoid walls of bold or ALL CAPS.
- **Think about mobile.** Most emails are read on phones. Short paragraphs and clear structure matter.
- **Reply promptly.** Even if you cannot fully respond, acknowledge receipt and set a timeline.
