# Social Media Skill

Create platform-optimized social media content that drives engagement and supports business goals.

## Platform Guidelines

### Twitter / X
- **Character limit:** 280 characters (shorter performs better).
- **Hook:** First line must stop the scroll. Bold claim, question, or contrarian take.
- **Thread format:** Number each tweet (1/N). First tweet is the hook. Last tweet is the CTA.
- **Engagement:** Ask questions. Polls get 2-3x more engagement.
- **Best practices:** 1-2 hashtags max. Images boost engagement 150%.

### LinkedIn
- **Tone:** Professional but personal. First-person storytelling works well.
- **Hook:** First 2 lines visible before "see more." Make them count.
- **Format:** Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences). Use line breaks generously.
- **Length:** 1,200-1,500 characters is the sweet spot.
- **Best practices:** Tag relevant people. Use 3-5 hashtags. Post early morning weekdays.

### Instagram
- **Visual-first:** Caption supports the image, not the other way around.
- **Caption structure:** Hook → Story/Value → CTA.
- **Hashtags:** 5-10 relevant hashtags (mix of popular and niche).
- **Stories:** Polls, questions, and countdowns drive engagement.

### General
- **One idea per post.** Don't try to say everything at once.
- **CTA in every post.** Like, comment, share, click link, DM.
- **Post consistently.** Regular cadence beats sporadic volume.
- **Engage back.** Reply to comments within the first hour.

## Content Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Educational | Build authority | "3 mistakes to avoid when..." |
| Behind-the-scenes | Build trust | "Here's how we actually..." |
| Social proof | Build credibility | Customer quote + results |
| Engagement bait | Boost reach | "Agree or disagree: ..." |
| Promotional | Drive action | Product launch, offer |

## Hashtag Strategy

- **Branded:** Your unique hashtag (e.g., #Agent42).
- **Industry:** Common in your field (e.g., #AI, #DevTools).
- **Trending:** Relevant current trends (use sparingly, only when genuine).
- **Community:** Niche community tags (e.g., #BuildInPublic).

## Scheduling

- **Batch create:** Write a week of posts in one session.
- **Mix content types:** Don't post 5 promotional posts in a row.
- **Test timing:** Track when your audience is most active.
- **Repurpose:** Turn blog posts into threads, quotes into images, data into charts.
