# Brand Guidelines Skill

Ensure consistency in voice, visual identity, and messaging across all outputs.

## Voice & Tone

### Defining Brand Voice
A brand voice has 3-5 characteristics that stay constant. Tone shifts by context.

**Example Voice Definition:**
| Attribute | We are | We are not |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Confident | Direct, assured | Arrogant, dismissive |
| Helpful | Practical, clear | Condescending, vague |
| Human | Warm, approachable | Robotic, corporate |

### Tone Spectrum
The same voice adapts to context:
- **Celebration:** Warm, enthusiastic, exclamation-worthy.
- **Education:** Clear, patient, step-by-step.
- **Error/Crisis:** Calm, honest, solution-oriented.
- **Sales:** Confident, benefit-focused, urgent but not pushy.

### Writing Rules
- **Use active voice.** "We launched" not "It was launched."
- **Be specific.** Numbers, names, and examples over vague claims.
- **Write for humans.** Read it aloud — if it sounds robotic, rewrite.
- **One idea per sentence.** Break long compound sentences.
- **Avoid:** Jargon, "leverage," "synergy," "best-in-class," "cutting-edge."

## Visual Identity

### Color
- **Primary palette:** 2-3 core colors used consistently.
- **Secondary palette:** Complementary colors for accents and variety.
- **Functional colors:** Success (green), warning (amber), error (red), info (blue).
- **Contrast:** Always verify text contrast ratios (WCAG AA: 4.5:1).

### Typography
- **Heading font:** Display/serif for personality.
- **Body font:** Sans-serif for readability.
- **Scale:** Consistent sizing system (e.g., 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48).
- **Weight:** Use 2-3 weights max (regular, medium, bold).

### Spacing
- **Grid system:** 8px base unit (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64).
- **Consistent margins:** Same spacing between similar elements.
- **Breathing room:** Don't crowd elements — whitespace is a design tool.

### Imagery
- **Style:** Photography vs. illustration vs. icons — pick one primary style.
- **Quality:** No pixelated, stretched, or watermarked images.
- **Representation:** Diverse, authentic, aligned with audience.

## Messaging Framework

### Core Messages
1. **Positioning statement:** For [audience], [product] is [category] that [key differentiator].
2. **Tagline:** One memorable line that captures the brand promise.
3. **Elevator pitch:** 30-second description of what you do and why it matters.

### Message Hierarchy
1. **Primary message:** The single most important thing. Used in headlines.
2. **Supporting messages:** 3-5 proof points that back up the primary.
3. **Proof points:** Specific data, testimonials, features that prove each message.

### Consistency Checklist

When reviewing any content for brand consistency:
- [ ] Does the tone match the brand voice attributes?
- [ ] Are colors from the approved palette?
- [ ] Is typography consistent with the system?
- [ ] Does the messaging align with the positioning statement?
- [ ] Are claims backed by proof points?
- [ ] Would this feel at home next to other brand materials?

## Using This Skill

When a workspace has brand guidelines in a `brand/` or `guidelines/` directory,
agents should load those files as reference context and follow them. This skill
provides the framework when project-specific guidelines don't exist.
