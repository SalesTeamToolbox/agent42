# Email Marketing

## Subject Lines
- Keep under 50 characters for mobile preview
- Use numbers, questions, or urgency (without being spammy)
- A/B test 2-3 subject lines per campaign
- Personalize with recipient name or company when available
- Avoid spam triggers: ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation, "free", "act now"

## Preview Text
- 40-130 characters that complement (not repeat) the subject
- Treat as a second subject line — adds context or intrigue

## Email Structure (AIDA Framework)
1. **Attention** — Hook in the first sentence (stat, question, bold claim)
2. **Interest** — Connect to their pain point or aspiration
3. **Desire** — Show the transformation / benefit with specifics
4. **Action** — Single, clear CTA (button or link)

## Call to Action Best Practices
- One primary CTA per email (avoid choice paralysis)
- Use action verbs: "Start your trial", "Download the guide", "Book a demo"
- Place CTA above the fold and repeat at the end
- Make the button visually distinct

## Campaign Sequences
- **Welcome series** (3-5 emails): Introduce, educate, activate
- **Nurture series** (4-6 emails): Value-first content, case studies, social proof
- **Re-engagement** (2-3 emails): "We miss you", exclusive offer, last chance
- **Post-purchase** (3-4 emails): Onboarding, tips, upsell, review request

## Deliverability Tips
- Maintain consistent sending schedule
- Clean list regularly (remove bounces, inactive > 90 days)
- Use double opt-in for quality subscribers
- Authenticate with SPF, DKIM, DMARC
- Keep text-to-image ratio at 60:40 or higher

## Metrics to Track
- Open rate (benchmark: 20-25%)
- Click-through rate (benchmark: 2-5%)
- Conversion rate
- Unsubscribe rate (keep below 0.5%)
- List growth rate

## Tools Integration
- Use `template` tool with "email-campaign" template for structure
- Use `content_analyzer` tool for readability and tone checks
- Use `scoring` tool with "email" rubric for quality evaluation
- Use `persona` tool to tailor tone and messaging to audience
